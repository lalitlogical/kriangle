## Usage

Generate Authentication Module

`rails g kriangle:install [MODEL NAME] [MOUNT PATH] [column_name:type]`

i.e. If we want to generate the User model with Auth model (for authentication). So you can type below.

`rails g kriangle:install User Auth first_name`

Generate other module

`rails g kriangle:module MODULE_NAME [column_name:type]`

i.e. If you want to generate Post model with title, content column, you can type below.

`rails g kriangle:module Post title:string content:text`

By default generated the module not referenced to User model. You can enable it by passing reference: true

`rails g kriangle:module Post title:string content:text --reference=true`

If you want has_many association with User model, you should use below command.

`rails g kriangle:module Post title:string content:text --reference=true --has_many=true`
